# TypeSqfEdit
An open source editor for Arma 3 missions, with syntax highlighting and a live SQF and SQX analyzer service.

# Dev Environment
Visual studio 2017 or later and .NET 4.6.2.

# Github Branches
The live developer branch is the branch 'develop'.
New features/bug fixes/refactorings goes into feature branches named 'feature/[feature name]'.
The release branch is 'master', where all released is tagged with version number.

# Community Coding Policy
Comes later, but some important notes:

1. New development always goes into new feature branch named 'feature/[new feature name]', where [new feature name] is a descriptive name for the work being done.
2. Small features will be processed quicker. When starting a new feature, start with the simplest thing, and then build on it in future features.

# Disclaimer
TypeSqfEdit started as a project for me to learn VPF, thus the code may seem strangely organized. Things will approve through future refactorings.

Happy coding!
